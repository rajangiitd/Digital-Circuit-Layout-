# Digital-Circuit-Layout-
    On a digital circuit layout having n vertical and n horizontal wirings, problems may occur due to crossing of 2 wires.
    The Code uses AVL trees to count the cross-wirings and write the labels of wires that cross each other in theta(n+ number of crossings) time,
    which is better than O(n^2) time complexity.

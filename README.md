# Digital-Circuit-Layout-
    On a digital circuit layout having n vertical and n horizontal wirings, problems may occur due to crossing of 2 wires.
    The Code uses AVL trees to count the cross-wirings and write the labels of wires that cross each other,
    in theta(nlogn + number of crossings) time, which is better than O(n^2) or O(nC2) time complexity.
